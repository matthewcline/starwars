AppRegistry.registerComponent("MyApp", () => App);


Next, install react-native-gesture-handler. If you’re using the Expo managed workflow then you don’t need to do anything here, it’s included in the SDK. Otherwise:

# or with npm
# npm install --save react-native-gesture-handler

# Todo
add tests for getInitials()
add space between number and bby for birth year

# Issues
